Check constraints

The CHECK constraint is used to limit a column to certain range or string of characters. This is especially good for an age column where 
the age is 18+, or where the column must be a yes or no answer. The example syntax of these is:
CHECK (Age>=18)

And 

CHECK (USCitizen = ‘Yes’ or USCitizen = ‘No’)

A bad check constraint would be if a check constraint was put on a first name column. There aren’t many situations where it would make 
sense to do this. There are far too many names in America for this to make sense. These constraints are useful so that unwanted data is 
not inserted into certain columns of a table.
